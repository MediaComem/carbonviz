It is only made possible by an extraordinary profusion of resources: thousands of kilometers of submarine cables that connect continents, colossal data centers that are constantly running at full speed to guarantee a flawless availability of content, fleets of satellites roaming from every corner of earth's orbit to keep us connected even while we are asleep, factories that manufacture hundreds of millions of technical devices that we often completely ignore.",

This user growth implies that the data traffic also drastically increased to reach around 20.6 zettabyte (ZB), which represent 2e13 gigabyte (GB), and is 12 times the 2010's consumption [2] [3]. Accordingly, the electricity consumption of the internet significantly increased to reach around 5% of the world's consumption in 2012, and could reach 20% by 2025 [4] [5].",
        "part2": "The increase in online usage, and the growth of data, raises the question of the environmental footprint of digital technology.

In addition, current models are not always transparent and not suitable for Switzerland, especially regarding the specific swiss energy mix that is constituted in a majority of hydro power. That's why we decided to design a new transparent calculation model to understand the environmental impact of digital activities to be used in Switzerland.",

        "part2": "Electricity can be generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, biomass, etc.) or non-renewable sources (coal, oil, gaz, nuclear, etc.). The electricity used is then a mix of those different sources. Each country has a different mix of sources. For instance, the electricity mix consumed in Switzerland is composed of roughly 35% hydro power and 41% nuclear [14]. In some cases a user or a company can decide to purchase only electricity from renewable-energy, in that case a 100% renewable electricy mix is used. In Switzerland the 100% renewable mix is composed at 98% of electricity from hydro power plant. Some cloud providers like Google also purchased 100% renewable energy to cover the consumption of their data centers [15].",
        "part3": "The climate impact from electricity can change drastically based on the electricity mix used. 1kWh of electricity from the 100% renewable mix in Switzerland will emit only 4.4g of fossil Co2 while the standard mix will emit 105g [14].",
        "part4": "The grey energy encapsulated in 1kWh of electricity also depends a lot on the source of energy, electricity from fossil fuels will depend on much more primary energy, in particular due to the low efficiency while converting fossil energy to electricity and loss of energy through heat."

        "part1": "Let's analyze the climate impact (measured by the Global Warming Potential in kg CO2 equivalent) of 1 hour video streaming at 720p.",
        "part2": "The CarbonViz method clearly shows that the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of watching a 720p video for one hour on a 6.5 years lifespan laptop is significantly lower when renewable energy mix is used compared to a standard energy mix. In the case of video streaming, this is mainly due to the impact of the server electricity and the core network electricity which represents more than 2/3 of the impact in case of a standard mix.As can be seen below, in case of renewable mix, the embodied impact of the laptop (the impact coming from the full manufaturing and transport) becomes  predominant. Both end users and internet services have an impact on the GWP: the impact for internet services being highly dependent on the source of energy (renewable or standard), the end-user impact coming mainly from the device manufacturing.",
        "part3": "The method also shows that the energy needed (primary energy to produce the electricity) to watch the video is much lower with a renewable mix. This is due to the large quantity of Non Renewable Energy (NRE) used in a standard mix compared to the renewable mix that is based more on Renewable Energy (RE). Indeed, the primary energy needed for non-renewable electricity production is higher in case of non renewable sources (in part due to loss in heating energy during electricity production from fossiel fuels for example).",
        "subtitle2": "2. Compared impact of a 6.5 and 4 year lifespan laptop",
        "part4": "CarbonViz assumes by default a 6.5 years lifetime for computers. Let’s check the impact if the user renews his computer after only 4 years.",
        "part5": "When watching a 720p video for 1 hour, we observe that the GWP is noticeably lower with a 6.5 year lifespan laptop than a 4 year one. The end user choice of computer lifespan has an influence to reduce the GWP impact.",

To what this amount of energy can be compared ?",
      "analogies_explanation2": "This is the question we asked several people while conducting brainstorming sessions with the goal to understand more what’s their understanding of energy and how can we compare a specific amount of energy to make it more tangible. The brainstorming sessions brought us many possible analogies to talk about a quantity of energy. We choose and implemented multiple and heterogeneous analogies to help bridge the gap between web activities and the real world.",
