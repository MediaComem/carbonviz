**Making the climate impact of your web browsing visible.**

CarbonViz is a browser extension that visualizes the environmental impact of our digital activities by displaying real-time data consumption and associated CO2 emissions while browsing the web.

## üåç About

Every day, we consume data that travels across the internet. Accessing online content seems normal and obvious, but "online" means that data travels from somewhere to our favorite browser. This journey is neither easy nor free. Dematerialization is very costly in terms of resources, infrastructure, and ultimately energy costs.

CarbonViz addresses this issue by seeking to improve perception and understanding of digital energy issues. To better represent this information, analogies were chosen in co-creation with concerned users. CarbonViz aims to raise awareness of the cost generated by our daily use of the Web.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: View your data consumption and CO2 emissions as you browse
- **Visual analogies**: Easy-to-understand comparisons to help grasp the environmental impact
- **Cross-browser support**: Available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
- **Privacy-focused**: The data stays on your device and is not shared with third parties
- **Educational**: Raises awareness about digital environmental impact
